            Vista College Preparatory/ Videographer
            June 2017 - February 2018
            With a close friend, I volunteered to create a promotional video for a charter school that focuses on
            teaching children
            in impoverished communities. This is the first video I made for an organization.
            YMCA / Videographer
            June 2018 - Now
            I recently got a position with the marketing department at the YMCA creating videos which promote programs
            and specific
            areas of the YMCA. I create my own schedule for work which allows me to develop my own sense of
            responsibility and
            accountability. Aside from this, I am able to learn from those who are in top positions in a company.
            Youth and Government / Extra-curricular Activity
            February 2016 – July 2018
            Youth and Government has been a major part of my life since Sophomore year of high school. I participated
            for three
            years making sure to do my best in every aspect. Participating in national events, I have gone to North
            Carolina and
            Washington D.C. Youth and Government has been formative in my perspective of the world. I do not just want
            to live in
            it; I want to help change it for the better.


            ￼
            YMCA Youth Advocacy
            YMCA- 2018
            I was one of two chosen from my state by the Valley of the Sun YMCA to represent them in Washington DC in
            the YMCA’s
            national advocacy program. I traveled with the CEOs of Arizona's YMCAs, and I met with Arizona’s
            congressmembers to
            discuss legislation that would help the YMCA better help communities.
            Distinguished Scholars Award
            Brophy College Preparatory- 2018
            Brophy faculty and my peers chose me and fifteen other students of our class for this award for being
            students that
            represented them well in and outside of the class.
            Michael Elms Award
            Youth and Government-2017
            The Michael Elms Awards is given to the participant who participated and debated others with the utmost
            compassion and
            dedication to their own values. I was awarded the Michael Elms Award out of a conference of two hundred
            people.
